# **App Name**: Math Companion Pro

## Core Features:

- Interactive Lessons: Comprehensive math lessons written in Arabic, covering theoretical explanations, definitions, laws, and examples for the 2AS (second year of secondary education) curriculum.
- Computational Laboratory: A suite of interactive tools including a Neon Grapher (function plotter built with Chart.js), Delta Solver (quadratic equation solver with step-by-step solutions), and Barycenter Calculator (coordinate calculator based on weights).
- Curated Scientific Articles: Full-page, expanded articles on the applications of mathematics in medicine (MRI, Fourier transform), cybersecurity (RSA encryption, prime numbers), and engineering (stress calculation).
- Kinetic Background: Animated numbers and floating mathematical symbols reacting to mouse movement, created using GSAP, to enhance visual engagement and identity.
- About Page: A dedicated 'About' page featuring Abdeldjalil Gouneiber's profile, mission statement, and a call to action for users interested in cybersecurity or programming.
- Adaptive Learning Tool: AI Tool assesses student progress through exercises and recommends relevant articles to bridge any knowledge gaps and reinforce understanding.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Deep Charcoal (#0a0a0a) for a modern, high-tech feel.
- Coordinate Grid: Fixed Dark Blue to give a mathematical feel without distracting from the lessons and tools.
- Glassmorphism: Use of backdrop-blur-xl and bg-white/5 with a cyan border for all components, and subtly enhances contrast and readability with this translucent look.
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for a modern, techy feel that is suitable for all headlines.
- Body Font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for clear, readable Arabic text, supporting a seamless right-to-left reading experience.
- Use of clear, geometric icons to represent lessons, tools, and articles. Maintain a consistent style to reinforce a cohesive brand identity.
- Use GSAP for kinetic background elements (numbers, math symbols), and subtle transitions/animations to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
